# astares
A play around hack around game framework project

## notice
I would recommend looking at the _v2 refactor branch and the astares .dll modules for the most up-to-date code and tests. I was going to make a dynamic module system for astares but now I am weighing the worthwhileness of it (*is that even a word?)
